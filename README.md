# Closet App

A simple web app for experimenting with AI-generated fashion descriptions and organizing your wardrobe.

## Pages
- **Home** – overview and welcome text.
- **My Closet** – upload clothing images, auto-generate a description, choose a season and store items locally.
- **Shop** – placeholder page for finding new looks.
- **Brand Ratings** – search top brands and view color-coded eco scores.
- **Ethics Info** – basic eco score table and tips on sustainable fashion.

The app uses vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To try the image captioning demo on the home page, provide your own HuggingFace API token in `script.js`.
